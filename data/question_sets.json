        {
          "question": "What is the central distinction between being 'rich' and being 'wealthy' as described in the text?",
          "options": [
            "A. Being rich means having high current income, while being wealthy means possessing unspent financial assets",
            "B. Being rich means owning luxury items, while being wealthy means having multiple income sources",
            "C. Being rich means having high savings, while being wealthy means having many properties",
            "D. Being rich is temporary, while being wealthy is permanent"
          ],
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The text differentiates 'rich' as having current high income that can support visible purchases, while 'wealth' is hidden, consisting of assets not yet spent that offer flexibility for the future.",
          "source_content": "Rich is a current income... But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later."
        },
        {
          "question": "According to the text, why is true wealth difficult to recognize and imitate?",
          "options": [
            "A. Because wealthy individuals often live in remote areas away from public view",
            "B. Because the signs of wealth are primarily hidden and not displayed in material possessions",
            "C. Because wealth depends entirely on inheritance records which are private",
            "D. Because society actively promotes laws against revealing one's net worth"
          ],
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The text states that wealth is the income not spent and thus does not manifest in visible, imitable forms like luxury goods, making it harder to recognize or model after.",
          "source_content": "The problem for many of us is that it is easy to find rich role models. It’s harder to find wealthy ones because by definition their success is more hidden."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does the exercise analogy illustrate the difference between being rich and being wealthy?",
          "options": [
            "A. Exercise is like wealth because it involves consistent savings of calories",
            "B. Exercise is like being rich because it indicates effort, but true wealth is like maintaining a calorie deficit through self-control",
            "C. Exercise and wealth are identical because they both avoid any form of consumption",
            "D. Exercise is like being wealthy because it's invisible to others"
          ],
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The author likens doing exercise to being rich—showing effort—but says wealth resembles self-control over not consuming a 'treat meal', thus accruing net gains over time.",
          "source_content": "Exercise is like being rich... Wealth is turning down that treat meal and actually burning net calories. It’s hard, and requires self-control."

            "C. People think billionaires are more financially secure than millionaires",
            "D. People believe having a high salary guarantees millionaire status"
          ],
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The author notes that people who say they want to be a millionaire often actually desire spending a million dollars, which is the opposite of building wealth.",
          "source_content": "When most people say they want to be a millionaire, what they might actually mean is 'I’d like to spend a million dollars.' And that is literally the opposite of being a millionaire."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why does the author say modern capitalism encourages misjudgment of people's wealth?",

          ],

          "explanation": "Modern capitalism has developed industries that allow people to 'fake it' by portraying the appearance of wealth without actually having it.",
          "source_content": "Modern capitalism makes helping people fake it until they make it a cherished industry."
        },
        {

          ],
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The author clearly states that the only way to be wealthy is not to spend the money you do have, keeping it as financial assets rather than converting it into visible consumption.",
          "source_content": "The only way to be wealthy is to not spend the money that you do have. It’s not just the only way to accumulate wealth; it’s the very definition of wealth."
        },
        {
          "question": "If a person wants to build real wealth according to the text’s principles, which choice best aligns with that goal?",

          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The text emphasizes keeping income unspent to retain flexibility and growth opportunities, making investing instead of indulging in visible consumption a wealth-building choice.",
          "source_content": "Wealth is the nice cars not purchased... Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see."
        },

          "options": [
            "A. Avoid making any assumptions about anyone's life",

            "D. Always verify income sources before judging"
          ],
          "correct_answer": "B",

          ],
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The text compares wealth to resisting a post-workout treat, creating a gap between capability and choice that accrues benefits over time.",
          "source_content": "Wealth is turning down that treat meal and actually burning net calories. It’s hard, and requires self-control."
        },
